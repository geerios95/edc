			<img src="img/TheWalkingDeadPoster.jpg" height="370" width="250" alt="">
			<p>The Walking Dead is an American horror drama television series developed by Frank Darabont, based on the comic book series of the same name by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard. Andrew Lincoln plays the show's lead character, sheriff's deputy Rick Grimes, who awakens from a months-long coma to confront an apocalyptic world overrun by zombies. Grimes reunites with his family and becomes the leader of a group he forms with other survivors. Together they struggle to survive in and adapt to a world filled with zombies and some humans who are even more dangerous than the zombies themselves.</p>
			<p>The first season through to the first half of the fifth season are at first set within the Atlanta metro area and then the surrounding countryside. The second half of the fifth season mainly takes place in Alexandria, Virginia.</p>
			<p>The Walking Dead premiered in the U.S. on October 31, 2010, on the cable television channel AMC and internationally in November 2010 on Fox International Channels. AMC has renewed the series each year because of its consistently increasing Nielsen ratings, which have been unprecedentedly high for a cable series, including averaging the most 18- to 49-year-old adult viewers of any cable or broadcast television series during its fourth and fifth seasons. The sixth season will premiere on October 11, 2015. An AMC companion series, Fear the Walking Dead, debuted on August 23, 2015.</p>
			<p>The series has been well received by critics and nominated for several awards, including the Writers Guild of America Award for Television: New Series and the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series â€“ Drama.</p>
